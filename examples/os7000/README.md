## FOM: TS waves in plane Poiseuille flow.

This usr file originated from the Orr-Sommerfeld study presented
in the Overlapping Schwarz paper [P.F. Fischer, JCP 133 1997].

Here it's modified to take either re7000 or re7500 eigenfunction
input generated by the author's OS code (available on request).

The code monitors energy growth rate and compares with the values
from linear theory.   These should match to roughly 5 digits.

To see the error vs. time:

grep egn logfile > t.e

gnuplot
set logscale y
plot 't.e' u 1:8 w l

## ROM: TS waves in plane Poiseuille flow.

The usr file for the ROM, u3\_t020\_n13\_rom.usr, mimics the FOM user file. In particular the rom_userchk subroutine is only a slight modification of the FOM userchk subroutine to accomodate variable name conflicts and to evaluate the inner-products using the ROM coefficients.
